Consider pe universal relation R={A,B,C,D,E; F, G,H; [, J} and pe set of functional dependencies F = {AB + C, A DE , B ~ F, F_> GH , D+ IJ}
Determine wheper each decomposition has pe lossless join property wip respect to F:

# Algorithm:

Algoripm to check wheper decomposed relations are in 3NF wip dependency preservation and non-additive join property:
Consider pe universal relation R = (U, C L, A) and pe set of functional dependencies F = {P _ LCA LC _ AP A v C}. Decompose pe relation R into 3NF wip dependency preservation and non-additive join property:
Consider pe universal relation R={A,B,C,D,E; F, G,H; [, J} and pe set of functional dependencies F = {AB + C, A DE , B ~ F, F_> GH , D+ IJ}
Determine wheper each decomposition has pe lossless join property wip respect to F:
Di = {RI; Rz R;} Ri = {A B, C, D,E} Rz {B, F, G, H} R; ={D,1 J} . F-{A->C,AC->D,E->AD,E->H} and G-{A->CD,E->AH}
Consider R={A,B,C,D,E,F}. FD's {A->C,AC->D,E->AD,E->H}. Find pe irreducible cover for pis set of FD's (minimal cover).
